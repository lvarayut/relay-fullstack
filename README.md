> Relay Fullstack is a Relay scaffolding application that aims to help you get up and running a project without worrying about integrating tools. It comes with many modern technologies; Relay, GraphQL, Express, ES6/ES7, JSX, Webpack, Babel, Material Design Lite, and PostCSS. Relay Fullstack is also using [Hot-reload](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr) to real time update the screen whenever any code changes.

## Example
![Demo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4281887/13377800/9c4705a2-de1d-11e5-82cb-745e16d5b1c4.gif)
> Check out the [Live demo](http://relay-fullstack.herokuapp.com) on Heroku.

## Usage

### Basic

The basic installation contains only general technologies needed by most of the projects, Relay Fullstack is totally unopinionated. If you wanted to include a database, flow, or any specific technologies, please see the [Advance](#advance) section.

Clone the repository to your local directory
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lvarayut/relay-fullstack.git
$ cd relay-fullstack
```

Install all dependencies & Start developing
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Launch your favorite web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` for Relay application or `http://localhost:8000` for GraphiQL.

### Advance

Relay Fullstack is integrated with Yeoman that allows you to choose technologies that suit your needs, the options are including database, flow, and etc.

Install `yo` and [generator-relay-fullstack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-relay-fullstack) globally

```bash
$ npm install -g yo generator-relay-fullstack
```

Create a new directory and start the generator, it will prompt some questions to help you get up and running

```bash
$ mkdir relay-fullstack && cd $_
$ yo relay-fullstack
$ npm start
```

Launch your favorite web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` for Relay application or `http://localhost:8000` for GraphiQL.

> NOTE: generator-relay-fullstack is currently working with minimal functionalities. Database, Flow, and Sub-generator are work-in-progress.

## Deployment

#### Local machine
In order to deploy a project, it is a good practice to minify all JavaScript files, stop spawning the GraphiQL server, pull off some duplicate dependencies, and remove all unnecessary scripts, for example, Hot-reload. All of these can be done by executing the following command:

```bash
$ npm run deploy
```

Again, launch your favorite web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Heroku
Before getting started, make sure you already installed the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com), which is a command-line tooling for managing Heroku applications that makes it easy to deploy an application in a few steps:

```bash
$ heroku create NAME_OF_YOUR_APP    # Create a new Heroku application
$ git push heroku master            # Push your code into the created Heroku repository
$ heroku ps:scale web=1             # Run the deployed application
````

That is it! Now, open the application on your default browser using `heroku open`.

## Schema

Whenever you start a server, it will automatically execute `updateSchema.js` script in order to compile the schema definitions, defined in `schema.js`, to `schema.json` and `schema.graphql`. This is required by Relay framework. However, you could also run the script manually:

```bash
$ npm run update
```
